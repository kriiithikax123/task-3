For Task 3 of the Cyber Security Internship, I did a basic vulnerability scan on my computer using a free tool called Nessus Essentials. The goal was to find common security problems and create a report. First, I installed Nessus and set my own computer's IP address (192.168.0.183) as the target for scanning. Then, I started a full scan using the “Basic Network Scan” option. The scan took about 8 minutes to finish. After it was done, I looked at the results. It found 23 vulnerabilities in total – 2 medium-level issues and the rest were just informational (low risk). I checked the details of the medium-risk issues, and the most serious one was called "SMB Signing not required". This means that attackers could possibly perform man-in-the-middle attacks because the SMB service on my PC doesn’t require secure signing. To fix this, I learned that on Windows, you can turn on a setting that forces message signing under network policies. I also checked the links and documentation provided in the report to understand it better. After that, I wrote down the important findings and took screenshots of the scan report, vulnerability list, and details of the main issue. This task helped me learn how to use free tools like Nessus to scan my system and find possible security risks so I can fix them early.
